Team Wisp is a student team from [Breda University of Applied Sciences](https://www.buas.nl/) working on a cutting-edge real-time ray-tracing framework. To showcase the power of their framework, they are actively developing a Maya plug-in.

This plug-in will bring real-time fully-lit rendered scene to the Maya viewport, eliminating the need to check a "slow" path tracer every time an artist would like to see the results of their work. This will result in a better workflow and more time spent iterating on the models instead of waiting for the existing "slow" renderers.

[Wisp](https://github.com/TeamWisp/Procedural-Ray-Tracing) is a real-time ray-tracing library built on top of [Direct3D 12](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3d12/direct3d-12-graphics) and [DXR](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/directx/2018/03/19/announcing-microsoft-directx-raytracing/). All low-level code is abstracted for the end-user, which makes it easier to integrate this framework in your own application without the need for a dedicated graphics programmer.
