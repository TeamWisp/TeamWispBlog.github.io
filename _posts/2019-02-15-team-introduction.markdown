Hi there, we're Team Wisp!

It's great having you here on our blog.

We're a student team from [Breda University of Applied Sciences](https://www.buas.nl/) working on a cutting-edge <i>real-time ray-tracing framework</i>. Our framework will allow anyone to unleash the power of the brand new [NVIDIA RTX series graphics cards](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/20-series/) in their next project!

To demonstrate the power of our framework, we're working on a plug-in for [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview) which uses the Wisp framework. This plug-in will <u>improve the modelling workflow</u> by giving users an in-viewport real-time representation of the final product. This will cut down on the iteration time drastically, as there will no longer be any need to run third-party pathtracers just to see what the final product will look like.

Our renderer will be capable of rendering <u>fully-lit scenes in the Maya viewport</u> at interactive or even real-time framerates.

Eliminating the render times during modelling will allow artists to focus on the things that are really important: the final product. We do not want to compete with existing rendering solution, instead, we see ourselves as an <i>addition to the artist's toolbox</i>.

We're excited to work on this project and hope that this little introduction has sparked your interest as well.

A preview of things to come:
