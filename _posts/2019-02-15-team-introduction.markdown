Hi there, we're Team Wisp!

It's great having you here on our blog.

We're a student team from [Breda University of Applied Sciences](https://www.buas.nl/) working on a cutting-edge real-time ray-tracing framework names <i>Wisp</i>. Our framework will allow anyone to unleash the power of the brand new [NVIDIA RTX series graphics cards](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/20-series/) in their next project!

To demonstrate the power of our framework, we're working on a plug-in for [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview) which uses the Wisp framework. This plug-in will improve the modeling workflow by giving artists an <u>in-viewport real-time representation of the final product</u>. This will cut down on the iteration time drastically, as there will no longer be any need to run "slow" path tracers just to see what the final product will look like.

Our renderer will be capable of rendering fully-lit scenes in the Maya viewport at real-time framerates.

Eliminating the render times during modeling will allow artists to focus on the things that are really important: the final product. We do not want to compete with existing rendering solution, instead, we see ourselves as an <i>addition to the artist's toolbox</i>.

We're excited to work on this project and hope that this little introduction has sparked your interest as well.

A preview of things to come:
